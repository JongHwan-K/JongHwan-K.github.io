Welcome to my academic website! I am Jonghwan Kim, a Ph.D. student at the Graduate School of Data Science, Seoul National University.

## Research Interests

My research focuses on the intersection of **causal inference and machine learning**. I am particularly interested in:

- **Causal Discovery**: Developing methods to identify causal relationships from observational data
- **Causal Machine Learning**: Integrating causal reasoning with machine learning algorithms
- **Time Series Causal Inference**: Extending causal machine learning to time series data


## Education

- **Ph.D.** (In Progress) - Seoul National University - Data Science
- **M.S.** - Seoul National University - Data Science
- **B.A.** - Seoul National University - Asian Studies, Sociology

## Current Research Project

I am currently working on **"Causal Normalizing Flow with Time Series Data"** in collaboration with LG AI Research. This project explores the application of autoregressive normalizing flows to estimate causal effects under time-varying treatments.


## Recent News

- **UAI 2024**: Paper accepted at the 40th Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI 2024)
  - **Title**: "Causal Discovery with Deductive Reasoning: One Less Problem"
