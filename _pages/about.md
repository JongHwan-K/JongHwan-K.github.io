Welcome to my webpage! I am Jonghwan Kim, a Ph.D. student at the Graduate School of Data Science, Seoul National University, advised by Prof. Sanghack Lee. My research focuses on trustworthy causal inference and uncertainty quantification in machine learning.

## Research Interests

My research focuses on the intersection of **causal inference and machine learning**, with particular emphasis on developing **trustworthy causal inference methods**. I am particularly interested in:

- **Causal Discovery**: Developing methods to identify causal relationships from observational data
- **Time Series Causal Inference**: Extending causal machine learning methods to time-varying treatment setting

Recently, I am deeply interested in **uncertainty quantification** as a means to achieve more reliable and valid causal inference. My work aims to develop methods that not only provide causal effect estimates but also quantify the uncertainty associated with these estimates, ensuring that the resulting inferences are trustworthy and can be safely used for decision-making in real-world applications.


## Education

- **Ph.D.** (2024-present) - Seoul National University - Data Science (advised by Prof. Sanghack Lee)
- **M.S.** (2022-2024) - Seoul National University - Data Science (advised by Prof. Sanghack Lee)
- **B.A.** (2015-2022) - Seoul National University - Asian Studies, Sociology

## Current Research Project

I am currently working on **"Causal Normalizing Flow with Time Series Data"** in collaboration with LG AI Research. This project explores the application of autoregressive normalizing flows to estimate causal effects under time-varying treatments.

## Experience

- **Research Scientist Intern** (2025.02 - present) - LG AI Research, Data Intelligence Lab
