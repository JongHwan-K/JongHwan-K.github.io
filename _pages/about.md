Welcome to my academic website! I am Jonghwan Kim, a Ph.D. student at the Graduate School of Data Science, Seoul National University.

## Research Interests

My research focuses on the intersection of **causal inference and machine learning**. I am particularly interested in:

- **Causal Discovery**: Developing methods to identify causal relationships from observational data
- **Causal Machine Learning**: Integrating causal reasoning with machine learning algorithms
- **Time Series Causal Inference**: Extending causal inference methods to temporal data

## Current Position
